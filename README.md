# AZOV
Value System Program AZOV for TI-81

Development Journal for Input Computations

It would be trivial to implement most of this code as RISC-V or any standard assembler. However with so much 'stuff' that a computer needs, it feels like doing heart surgery on a morbidly obese person. I am up to my elbows in complexity with enough infrastructure at my disposal to scale any cloud architecture I could possibly want, so instead I'm on a system that needs none of that and is older than most of my surviving relatives.

If you want to replicate this experience, cozy up to any old terminal, get your cat, and the devil may care where you goto.
